# PIE-Project-Drink-Mixer
 Repository for the Fall 2021 PIE Project for making a drink mixing and serving machine.

 The following libraries must be installed in the Arduino IDE in order to run this code:
 1. <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html">Teensyduino</a>
 2. <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/ili9341_t3/">ILI9341_t3</a>
 3. <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/xpt2046_touchscreen/">XPT2046_Touchscreen</a>
 4. <a href="https://github.com/Stan-Reifel/TeensyUserInterface/">Stan Reifelâ€™s Teensy User Interface</a>
 5. <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel">Neopixel library</a>

 After that, it's as simple as running the single file `drink_pourer_with_LCD.ino` with the appropriate hardware set up! For testing the code, the solenoid valves can be substituted with LEDs.
